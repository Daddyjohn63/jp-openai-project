I will need to change the prompt in geratePost.js

Perhaps change the object returned form post to mail?? Make it more relevant. Also, I may want to add a second feature where the user can generate a mail and seo post response.

Will need dynamic inputs for,

- campaign name (create campaing names separately and then when creating an email, they select the campaign.)
- Book title
- Book author(s)
- Book illustrator
- Launch date(?)
- Book binding details
- Introduction by

Do we need a summary of what the book is about? and in how many words?
